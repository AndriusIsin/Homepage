                <p id="about">I moved to England at the age of 27 and have mostly been working as a machine operator. I would like to change my job and start working in tech industry. I have always liked programming and I think I could be good at it as I have many ideas on how to improve some processes, also I have some ideas for new apps which have not yet been created. I find tech industry really interesting and fascinating. I think that development of this industry makes people lives easier and better. This industry offers unlimited growing and learning opportunity and allows people to really use their abilities. I would love to be a part of this environment!</p>
